      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;written-halfway-through-my-summer-internship-in-berlin&#34;&gt;Written halfway through my summer internship in Berlin.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a shock, but at this point I’m more than halfway through my internship. Soon, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to start dismantling the fledgling routine I’ve only just started to establish for myself — getting up, eating, biking to work, trying to stop sweating before I step into the lobby, working, then repeating the whole thing in reverse. I’ll have to sell my purple secondhand bike back to the shop, mail  excess belongings home (neither pair of heels have been touched), and buy a backpack for the next leg of my European travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have I done so far? I’ve had incredible beer. I’ve frequently gotten lost on my bike, both accidentally and deliberately. I’ve attended countless fitness classes that I got through not by successfully understanding the instructor&amp;rsquo;s rapid-fire Deutsch, but through a strategy that I like to call quick,-mimick-that-girl&amp;rsquo;s-asana. I’ve bopped in clubs to wordless music, dressed head-to-toe in black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dresden I hiked, picnicked, and spent too long in the Hygiene Museum. In Copenhagen I walked 30km each day through the narrow streets and squeezed into a three-tier hostel bunk bed each night. I was led through sketchy bushes and old shipping crates as part of a photography festival, one which has inspired me to put &amp;ldquo;make ethnographic films&amp;rdquo; on my to-do list. I also saw a morbid but hilariously crude ballet performance about death. In Salzburg I escaped Salzburg and hiked through Berchtesgaden instead. I’ve been approached by more strangers than ever before, and I’ve worked up the nerve to talk to more strangers than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some photos from various stints in various places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woman on a bench outside the Kunstquartier Bethanien.
I take a lot of pictures of strangers, and maybe that makes me a freak. But I find people are so much more interesting than landmarks or buildings. I always notice if a lady is wearing a bright yellow hat or is eating ice cream on a grotty park bench or whatever, and I always find it absurdly photographable. Idk guys, people are beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Views of Salzburg.
At the entrance to the Mirabell Gardens I took the first picture, turned 180 degrees around and took the second picture. It’s always funny how people flock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deceptive Photo of The Most Touristy Street in Salzburg.
I like to play a game called Can I Make It Look Like I’m The Only Tourist Here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copenhagen Child.
God, I am so weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the best brunch buffet I have ever been to. There was such a variety of food: salads, cake and brownie slices, vegan scrambled eggs, amazing quiches, chili, deliciously crispy mini pancakes and hot compote, strawberry polenta, orange/vanilla-lavender chia pudding, yoghurts, little glass jars of thick mousses, various dips, warm bread rolls and pretzels, vegan charcuterie and cheeses. Wow, I died. I&amp;rsquo;m really not the kind of person that starves themselves to go to a buffet and binges on twenty plates, so I was pretty surprised at myself when I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but keep eating and trying EVERYTHING. It was all so fresh and perfectly seasoned and tasty. I went through seven plates&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service was great, too. Sure, initially I had to wait a while to get a table because the girl seating guests was on the phone having a slow conversation and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t look me in the eye, which was rude, but the waiter that I ended up getting was incredibly polite, friendly, and whisked my plates away regularly so that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to st&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Absent Conclusions</title>
      <link>https://saffronhuang.com/post/absent-conclusions/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-reflection-after-harvard-college-israel-trek-a-spring-break-trip-i-was-fortunate-enough-to-attend&#34;&gt;A reflection after Harvard College Israel Trek, a spring break trip I was fortunate enough to attend.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m back at Harvard now. It’s surreal and a little nostalgic to think that, rather than flurries of snow outside, we had desert heat bearing down on us just two weeks ago. Rather than red brick rising up around us and slush at our feet, we stood amidst pale Jerusalem stone and cats mewling on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that I’m &amp;lsquo;not prepared&amp;rsquo; to be back at school. I’m just craving a little more — more of what I was able to see, hear, feel, taste, touch and engage with over spring break. The Trek, made me appreciate how &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; there is out there in the world, and how interesting it all is. This should be a simple revelation, but it seems that every time I travel, I&amp;rsquo;m knocked over with the force of this sentiment as if I were learning it for the first time. (Or maybe gaining a deepening understanding of something feels almost the same as learning it afresh.) Two hops away by plane, I found incredibly diverse, rich lives humming away. Lives that I could only attempt to get close to and learn about during our short 10 days there, and ones that I found extremely difficult to define or generalize about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe what I’m trying to say is that things weren’t cohesive and tidy and my summary is not cohesive and tidy, and that’s just how it is. Israel/Palestine is not just a &amp;lsquo;conflict&amp;rsquo; or a &amp;lsquo;situation&amp;rsquo;. People live there, yes, despite everything. They have to. The Israel-Palestinian conflict has been a daily reality for decades, residing in the backs of minds and wearing its way into attitudes in both obvious and imperceptible ways. But then, it is a daily reality, so people grow around it and create realms outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are beautiful, straight-up people with uplifting attitudes that I miss, and a tapestry of landscapes that should belong to five different countries. There are Purim festivities where strangers will amiably compliment your purple tiger face paint, and hilariously absurd stories passed around of old Russian grandmothers and their American vacuum cleaners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrestled with and attempted to reconcile everything that I saw. Who are you? What’s your story? Why do you say the things that you do, and why are things the way that they are? How does the conflict play a role in this? Why does the conflict not play a role in this? It was a week of questioning, considering, evaluating, and running out of time. But even if I could have poked into every single speaker’s life, and dissected every person’s stories, the kind of satisfaction permitted by fitting a general solution, a thesis, or a conclusion&amp;mdash;of the kind we are taught to search for in class&amp;mdash;would still have eluded me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in everyday life, there exist things that seem contradictory and incompatible. Israel is simultaneously a place for growing numbers of ultraorthodox Jews who decline to push elevator buttons on Shabbat, a place where gay pride flags flutter off Tel Aviv balconies, and a place where 19-year-old military kids run the most popular radio station, often using the airwaves to criticise the military itself. We visited a school for children of refugees and migrant workers, where the girls’ athletic team proudly competed for Israel at the Schools Olympic Games, despite difficulty getting through international borders, because the country they represented did not even permit them their requisite papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Bank had its own surprises. I cannot deny the unease I felt driving through checkpoints into zones ominously marked A, B, or C, noticing rubbish littering the landscape, people with intimidatingly large guns staring at our bus, and settlements in the distance. Just having an inkling of the degree of conflict and anguish that has occurred and is occurring over the land I was on was unnerving. But it would be inaccurate to paint this as the whole picture. As we clambered off the bus in Ramallah, a sprawling lunch awaited us at a large, modern hotel, with beautiful Palestinian art on the walls. What kinds of travellers keep hotels like this in business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And The Conflict itself — well, again, I didn’t walk away with a fleshed-out solution. Of course not. Old questions went unanswered and new questions arose. (For example, I’m still wondering how Israel can navigate being simultaneously Jewish and democratic.) Will signing a negotiation be healing in the way we hope? How much identity is tied up in hurt? Can we imagine Israel without a conflict with Palestine? Can we imagine Palestine without a conflict with Israel? Honestly, I’m not sure if this trip made me more or less inclined towards a career in international relations. Sometimes, political leadership and negotiation processes can be — simply put — the absolute pits, and sometimes, throwing more effort and people at a problem doesn’t seem to have an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my most valuable questions were not directed at the things I saw and the people I met. I also experienced uneasy moments of questioning myself. Upon arrival at a picturesque winery in Golan Heights, we learned of the contested nature of the region - which also happens to possess conditions described as “perfect” for winemaking. The fifty of us proceeded to taste and enjoy the products of vineyards that could only be planted after 250 burned-out tanks were cleared from the landscape after the Valley of Tears Battle. The grapes that grew over and upon the sites of battle and bloodshed coloured my beverage, and my perceptions. The wine-tasting experience was a giggly, delicious, entertaining affair — should I feel guilty for having fun? How should I conduct myself, with the knowledge that I have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have no verdicts. I did not experience the satisfaction of developing a neat, unified opinion about Israel. But then, all the most interesting and worthwhile questions to think about in life don’t have solid answers. Too often we are encouraged to quickly form opinions about a text we only just skimmed, a show we just saw, or the person we just met. Not having answers forces you to keep engaging, so perhaps arriving at answers shouldn’t be the ultimate goal of proposing questions. One thing I did learn for sure is that all of this starts and ends with people — and here I refer less to the complications of people than to the people you meet that inspire you (I think all fifty of us can say this about our tour guide Amir), the people that dance on table-tops beside you and the people that have three-hour dinner conversations with you. Their importance is one conclusion I can count on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>City of Contrasts</title>
      <link>https://saffronhuang.com/post/city-of-contrasts/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even just within the 5 days I&amp;rsquo;ve spent in Bangkok, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so many different facets of this city. I&amp;rsquo;ve dined with a girl who spends all her time at malls and has a dad who shoots movies in Dubai. I&amp;rsquo;ve explored shopping malls (Siam Paragon, especially) targeted at the privileged, with gourmet food courts and McLarens parked in shiny exhibits on the fifth floor. But I&amp;rsquo;ve also wandered off into cramped, dusty side-streets, with crippled and blind folk shaking tin cups on the corner. Shacks fashioned from metal scraps teeter on the banks of the polluted river. In fact, most of the city reflects a country steeped in poverty and inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting contrast I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that between the religious and the irreverent. Thailand is a Buddhist country, where one is expected to dress modestly and obey large warning signs advising tourists not to buy Buddha heads as decorations. Temples are a fixture in any itinerary; wandering through these elaborate structures, my jaw agape, has provided valuable insight into the ancient customs and beliefs that infuse the Thai way of life. The culture of reverential respect extends beyond religious deference - today, Catherine, Zhong and I wandered into a hospital/university with an enormous picture of the Thai king stretched across a building, and a monument beside which people were kneeling and praying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, Thailand maintains an infamy that, I daresay, nobody would call pious. The city seems to wake up at night and one can enter into any manner of crazed debauchery possible. From the Patpong red light district to neon dildoes sold at streetside markets right beside Buddha miniatures, Thailand&amp;rsquo;s weird open-but-also-repressed impropriety is what makes it such an infamous destination for wacky stag parties and unforgettable nights out. Even simple things such as the number of transgender people I see around points to a country where people seem more free in their sexuality. However, sex tourism and trafficking are gigantic problems here. The thriving prostitution industry is actually only semi-legal and  badly regulated, and  worryingly, those girls are often in highly sketchy and dangerous situations that both the mass media and tourists choose to overlook for the sake of cheap entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, simply getting slightly lost will highlight the difference between &amp;ldquo;touristy&amp;rdquo; Bangkok and the locals&#39; actual everyday lives. I experienced the peak of such agony at Grand Palace, where I paid 500 THB to bake in 36 degree heat and be assaulted by swarms of people waving iPads, and street vendors conducting trade at excessive decibels, charging inflated prices for pomegranate juice and river cruises. In some ways this is hypocritical because the obvious fact is, I am a tourist too. But the vibe and claustrophobia of tourist traps are hard to bear. Yet in the multiple times that we have thrown away the figurative map (whether accidentally or on purpose) and meandered around the city, we have glimpsed far more valuable things for free. We have wandered through cramped sidewalk markets selling unfamiliar ingredients, tempted by stalls serving up deliciously fresh salads, noodle soups and desserts. Even just taking the water taxi (a fancy name for a public boat) and getting completely lost up the river showed us a dustier, more industrial, more residential facet of Bangkok. Wherever you are and wherever you&amp;rsquo;re heading, make it a point to get lost.&lt;/p&gt;
